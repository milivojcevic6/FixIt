FixIt is an information system whose main application gathers car lovers in one place.
FixIt is implemented in the form of a kind of blog.
The project was created for the needs of the subject systems3. 
Since time was limited, project implementation was done using the CodeIgniter framework.

The FixIt information system currently supports the following functionalities:
 *Register function (through which users can create an account),
 *Login functionality (to log in to the account),
 *Creating posts that can contain images (beside of images that posts can contain, is required to have title, body and to belong to a certain category),
 *Editing posts (For creator or administrator, it is possible to change later parts of the post such as title, body..),
 *Deleting posts (Any post can be deleted, but only by the creator or administrator),
 *Uploading videos to the post (The video can be uploaded to the post, on which page view it could then be played, and the image that was there until then, remains only as thumbnail. Only admin and the creator are able to do it),
 *Creating categories (Admin has the ability to create categories / topics for posts.),
 *Deleting categories(Admin is the only one that can modify them),
 *Search by category (All users, even those visitors without an account, are able to search the site by category),
 *Pagination feature (In order to easily keep a track of how on the posts)
 *Creating comments (Anyone can participate in the discussion below the post),
 *Support for static pages (Home page as well as contact page and about)
 
 List of technologies used:
 *Bootstrap - with its help, I was able to generate pages more easily. The classes it has have improved the layout of the facilities, and also helped me achieve complete responsiveness.
 *CodeIgniter framework - a simple and elegant toolkit to create full-featured web applications was something that I looked for and CI gave me that. In combination with php language.
 *PHPStorm – program is the place where all the magic came from. A very readable and accessible program in which confusion is rare thing for me.
 *Cloudflare & Ajax – proved me with some open source libraries which made the job easier.
 *CKEditor - thanks to him, I was able to provide users with more options while creating posts.
 *W3schools - I relied on their css in creating the homepage as an add-on Bootstrap.
 *SQL PhpMyAdmin – all the data is stored on FixIt database
 *XAMPP Apache Web Server – the environment with which I tried my system on the localhost domen.
 *WinSCP & PuTTY – were constantly open for me whenevery I had to check something on the server.
 *JetBrains – with PhpStorm I uploaded files on the online server while creating the code.
